Project Synoposis:
Nowadays where majority of veterinary hospitals adapt the high technology or IT, where computer has become a way of life and technology make things easy and possible. Some of pet care clinics are still using manual operation in their daily business transactions. We all know that modern pet care clinics are now striving to serve as many animals as possible.

Project Description:
Petrology (from Ancient Greek p?t??? (pétros) 'rock', and -????a (-logía) 'study of') is the branch of geology that studies rocks and the conditions under which they form. Petrology has three subdivisions: igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary petrology. Igneous and metamorphic petrology are commonly taught together because they both contain heavy use of chemistry, chemical methods, and phase diagrams. Sedimentary petrology is, on the other hand, commonly taught together with stratigraphy because it deals with the processes that form sedimentary rock
